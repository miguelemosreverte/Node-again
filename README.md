# Node-again
Let's see how long I take to build this thing.


Hello there!

I am taking a break of a project I have been working on all weekend;
I think I will finish it up on Monday. Check it out! [ReactiveExample](https://github.com/miguelemosreverte/ReactiveExample)

---------------
So, let's start.

First I will find a good React project skeleton.
I need Redux because it allows me to decouple all interaction between components.
It's like Kafka in a frontend way.

Proposed Workflow:
I will propose a battle plan and go on about placing green ticks when completed in
expected time, and red marks when surpassed time expectations-

Battle plan:
- 5 min of README ✔
- 5 min of frontend setup ✔
- 20 min of modelling the solution on the backend using tests and an isolated,
pure, logic kernel
❌ -- took 20 min longer, was out of practice
❌ -- _and then it took 20 min more!_
- 10 min of setting up a health api using KoaJS ✔
- 10 min of setting up React Redux sagas to hit the health api✔
- 10 min of setting up a basic auth with JWT token (this i have done many times before) ✔
- 10 min of setting of a docker-compose with mongodb (this i have done many times before) ✔
- Well catch up from here.


❌ -- big X. I tried to work on top of an old repository of mine, [link](https://github.com/miguelemosreverte/CRUD-with-Koa-and-React-Native), which now I find severely lacking.

What I would propose to do with the time left is focus on delivering value instead of
insisting on a slow workflow that while could be encouraged for its merits, (good unit tests?),
would not end on a good application: The time needed to create a well architectured
project from memory and from ground up I do not find it here, not at this moment.

Hope you liked the [Done unit testing the tasks logic](https://github.com/miguelemosreverte/Node-again/commit/27f7fae09092ab9d5414fd791e7202defff972f0) and the [Done unit testing the login/logout/loggedIn logic](https://github.com/miguelemosreverte/Node-again/commit/7edefc53551341ce11cbddf9a0c539ae6f4a5bbb), but
I will focus on bringing this project to fruition on time and with well though arch,
even if I can't take credit for it myself.

Pivot point:
Having half the time spent, it is time to deliver, and do it _fast_, and _well_.

New Battle Plan:
Deploy web with correct contact points, and dive into the React application.
