# Node-again
Let's see how long I take to build this thing.


Hello there!

I am taking a break of a project I have been working on all weekend;
I think I will finish it up on Monday. Check it out! [ReactiveExample](https://github.com/miguelemosreverte/ReactiveExample)

---------------
So, let's start.

First I will find a good React project skeleton.
I need Redux because it allows me to decouple all interaction between components.
It's like Kafka in a frontend way.

Proposed Workflow:
I will propose a battle plan and go on about placing green ticks when completed in
expected time, and red marks when surpassed time expectations-

Battle plan:
- 5 min of README ✔
- 5 min of frontend setup ✔
- 20 min of modelling the solution on the backend using tests and an isolated,
pure, logic kernel
- 10 min of setting up a health api using KoaJS
- 10 min of setting up React Redux sagas to hit the health api
- 10 min of setting up a basic auth with JWT token (this i have done many times before)
- 10 min of setting of a docker-compose with mongodb (this i have done many times before)
- Well catch up from here.
